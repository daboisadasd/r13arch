# r13arch
An install script designed to build an sd card bootable by an Acer r13 chromebook. This is based off of the installation guide thankfully provided by archlinuxarm.org.
The original instructions can be found at https://archlinuxarm.org/platforms/armv8/mediatek/acer-chromebook-r13
This script requires Chromebrew to be installed and you can do that at https://github.com/skycocker/chromebrew or you can run curl -Ls git.io/vddgY | bash to install it.
